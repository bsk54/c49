C49 Project Overview
C49 is a structured, corpus-driven Chinese learning tool that packages vocabulary and usage into digestible, daily-sized lessons. Here’s how it works:
1.	Corpus & Frequency Basis
o	Vocabulary is drawn from the Weibo portion of the BCC (BLCU Chinese Corpus), a 15 billion-character balanced corpus maintained by Beijing Language and Culture University.
o	The Weibo subset reflects contemporary, colloquial usage, ensuring you learn the most relevant and high-impact words first.
2.	Lesson Structure
o	Each lesson delivers 7 new words (in order of descending frequency) plus 7 phrases that illustrate those words in context.
o	Lesson 1 covers the top-7 most frequent Weibo words; Lesson 2 covers positions 8–14; and so on.
3.	Learning Modes
o	Quiz: choose a pool of either 7 words, 21 words (current + next two lessons), or 49 words (current 49-item block), or their matching phrases, then test yourself. Incorrect items reappear within that selected pool until you exit.
o	49er Player: continuous audio playback of the current 49-item block (7 lessons × 7 words or phrases), perfect for passive tuning during commutes or workouts.
o	Info Section: compact grammar notes keyed to each lesson.
4.	Customization & Persistence
o	Adjustable playback speed, font size, theme, and autoplay settings.
